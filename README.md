## Breast Cancer Prediction Machine Learning Model (Focus on SVM)
Breast cancer is a serious global public health concern, and precise prediction of its occurrence is critical for early detection and effective treatment. This study investigates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect breast cancer and compares its performance to other machine learning (ML) algorithms.

The dataset for this study includes several factors relating to patient characteristics, tumour attributes, and medical history. Preprocessing procedures are used to clean and normalise the data, making it suitable for use in predictive modelling. The dataset is then split into training and testing datasets.

Support Vector Machines, which are well-known for their ability to handle high-dimensional data, are being used to predict breast cancer. Cross-validation is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the SVM model to improve its performance.

### This is what the project covers:
**Data Processing and Visualization**:

- The dataset will be preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques will be employed to gain insights into the distribution of features, identify patterns, and understand relationships between variables.

**Feature Engineering and Dimensionality Reduction**:

- Relevant features will be selected or engineered from the dataset to improve model performance and interpretability.
- Techniques such as dimensionality reduction, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), will be applied to reduce the number of features while preserving important information.

**Clustering Analysis**:

- Clustering algorithms, such as K-means clustering, will be applied to identify natural groupings or clusters within the dataset.
- Clustering results will be visualized to explore inherent structures and potential subgroups within the data.

**Building Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model**:

- A SVM model will be trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict breast cancer outcomes.
- Hyperparameter tuning techniques, such as grid search, will be utilized to optimize the SVM model's performance.

**Comparative Analysis**:

- The SVM model's performance will be evaluated and compared with other machine learning algorithms, including random forests, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and logistic regression, gaussianNB, decision tree.
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be calculated for each model to assess their predictive capabilities.

**Conclusion**:

- The study outcomes will be summarized, highlighting the effectiveness of SVM and other algorithms in predicting breast cancer.
- Insights gained from dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis will be discussed, along with implications for clinical practice and future research directions.
